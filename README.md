## Welcome to the Smida Syndicate (Team 4221) FTC Repository
Chances are that you are here as a new programmer on the robotics team. This repository contains the last three years of my (Nathan Smith)'s code from Velocity Vortex (2016-2017) to Rover Ruckus (2018-2019). All the code can be located under the TeamCode folder.
