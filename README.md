## Welcome to the Smida Syndicate (Team 4221) FTC Repository
Chances are that you are here as a new programmer on the robotics team. This repository contains the last three years of my (Nathan Smith)'s code from Velocity Vortex (2016-2017) to Rover Ruckus (2018-2019). All the code can be located under the TeamCode folder. The code base uses the Java (Velocity Vortex) and Kotlin (Relic Recovery + Rover Ruckus) languages. At this point FTC runs through two Android phones (currently using Moto G5) and connects into a REV expansion hub (for reference on how the setup works here). Hopefully this past code can be of use to you as you work on the current FTC challenge.
